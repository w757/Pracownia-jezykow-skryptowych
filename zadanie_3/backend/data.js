        "1984 is George Orwell's haunting prophecy about the future. And while 1984 has come and gone, his dystopian vision of a government that will do anything to control the narrative is timelier than ever. The story follows the life of one seemingly insignificant man, Winston Smith, in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation. It is a grim exploration of how power can corrupt and absolute power can corrupt absolutely.",
